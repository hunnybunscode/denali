## 3. Database Requirements

### Oracle Database Configuration
- [ ] **Database Usage**: Does the application require the Oracle database?
- [ ] **License Model**: 
  - `bring-your-own-license` - Customer provides Oracle licenses
  - `license-included` - AWS provides Oracle licenses (higher cost)
- [ ] **Instance Class**: Database performance requirements

- [ ] **Engine Version**: Preferred Oracle version (default: 19.0.0.0.ru-2025-07.rur-2025-07.r1)



## 4. File Storage Requirements

### EFS Configuration
- [ ] **File Storage Usage**: Does the application require shared file storage?
- [ ] **Mount Points**: Where should EFS be mounted in the container?
  - Default: `/mnt/efs`
  - Custom path: Specify required path
- [ ] **File Permissions**: Required file system permissions and ownership


## 5. SSL Certificate Requirements

### HTTPS Configuration
- [ ] **HTTPS Required**: Does the application require HTTPS?
- [ ] **IAM Server Certificate ARN**: ARN of certificate uploaded to IAM
  - Format: `arn:aws-us-gov:iam::account-id:server-certificate/certificate-name`

#### Instructions for Customer: Uploading SSL Certificate to IAM

If you require HTTPS, you must upload your SSL certificate to AWS IAM before deployment:

**Using AWS CLI:**
```bash
aws iam upload-server-certificate \
  --server-certificate-name your-certificate-name \
  --certificate-body file://certificate.pem \
  --private-key file://private-key.pem \
  --certificate-chain file://certificate-chain.pem
```

**Using AWS Console:**
1. Navigate to IAM Console â†’ Server Certificates
2. Click "Upload a server certificate"
3. Provide certificate name, certificate body, private key, and certificate chain
4. Note the certificate ARN for deployment

**After upload, provide us with the certificate ARN from the IAM console.**

## 6. Required Application Endpoints

### Mandatory Endpoints
The customer application **MUST** implement the following endpoints for proper infrastructure operation:

- [ ] **Health Check Endpoint**: Application must provide a health check endpoint
  - Path: `/health`, `/status`, or custom path specified by customer
  - Response: HTTP 200 status code when application is healthy
  - Content: Can be simple text ("OK") or JSON health status
  - Purpose: Used by ALB for health checks and auto-scaling decisions

- [ ] **Root Endpoint**: Application should respond to root path requests
  - Path: `/` 
  - Response: HTTP 200 or appropriate application response
  - Purpose: Basic connectivity testing and load balancer verification

### Optional but Recommended Endpoints
- [ ] **Metrics Endpoint**: For monitoring and observability
  - Path: `/metrics` or `/actuator/metrics`
  - Response: Application metrics in Prometheus or JSON format
  - Purpose: CloudWatch custom metrics and monitoring

- [ ] **Info Endpoint**: Application information
  - Path: `/info` or `/actuator/info`
  - Response: Application version, build info, etc.
  - Purpose: Deployment verification and troubleshooting

### Endpoint Requirements
- All endpoints must be accessible on the configured container port
- Health check endpoint must respond within 5 seconds
- Endpoints should not require authentication for infrastructure testing
- Must handle HTTP requests (HTTPS termination handled by ALB)

## 7. Testing and Validation

### Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] **Test Endpoints**: Verify all required endpoints are implemented
- [ ] **Load Balancer Testing**: Verify ALB can reach container health check
- [ ] **Database Connectivity**: Test database connection from container
- [ ] **File System Access**: Verify EFS mount functionality

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before beginning deployment, ensure you have collected:

### Required Information
- [ ] All network configuration details
- [ ] Container image and specifications
- [ ] Database requirements (usage and sizing)
- [ ] SSL certificate (if HTTPS required)
- [ ] PROJADMIN compliance requirements

### Customer Responsibilities
- [ ] Provide container image access
- [ ] Deliver SSL certificates (if required)
- [ ] Participate in infrastructure testing
- [ ] Approve final deployment

## Next Steps

Once all information is collected:

1. **Review and Validate**: Confirm all requirements with customer
2. **Prepare Deployment**: Set up deployment parameters
3. **Schedule Deployment**: Coordinate deployment timing
4. **Execute Deployment**: Follow deployment guide
5. **Test and Validate**: Verify all functionality works as expected
6. **Hand Over**: Transfer operational responsibility to customer team

This comprehensive checklist ensures all necessary information is collected before deployment, reducing the risk of deployment issues and post-deployment changes.
