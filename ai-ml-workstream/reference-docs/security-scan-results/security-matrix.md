# AWS Security Matrix Assessment

This document contains the security assessment of the Denali AI-ML Workstream project based on the AWS Security Matrix. The assessment focuses on the AWS services used in the project.

## AWS Lambda

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Lambda-1 | Non-Compliant | Lambda functions are not configured with a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) | Configure DLQs for all Lambda functions to capture failed executions |
| Lambda-2 | Non-Compliant | Lambda functions do not have concurrent execution limits defined | Set appropriate concurrent execution limits to prevent resource exhaustion |
| Lambda-3 | Compliant | Lambda functions are deployed within a VPC | Continue using VPC deployment for network isolation |
| Lambda-4 | Non-Compliant | Lambda environment variables are not encrypted | Configure encryption for Lambda environment variables |
| Lambda-5 | Compliant | Lambda functions have appropriate IAM roles | Continue using principle of least privilege |
| Lambda-6 | Compliant | Lambda functions have appropriate timeout settings | Continue monitoring for optimal timeout settings |
| Lambda-7 | Non-Compliant | Lambda functions do not implement proper error handling for HTTP requests | Add proper error handling with raise_for_status() and appropriate exception handling |
| Lambda-8 | Non-Compliant | Lambda functions do not have timeouts set for HTTP requests | Add timeouts to all HTTP requests to prevent hanging |

## AWS Step Functions

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| StepFunctions-1 | Compliant | Step Functions use appropriate IAM roles | Continue using principle of least privilege |
| StepFunctions-2 | Compliant | Step Functions have appropriate error handling | Continue using catch blocks for error handling |
| StepFunctions-3 | Compliant | Step Functions have appropriate timeout settings | Continue monitoring for optimal timeout settings |
| StepFunctions-4 | Compliant | Step Functions use appropriate retry policies | Continue using retry policies for transient errors |

## AWS Secrets Manager

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| SecretsManager-1 | Compliant | Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager | Continue using Secrets Manager for sensitive data |
| SecretsManager-2 | Non-Compliant | Hardcoded ARNs for secrets are used in the code | Use environment variables or parameters for secret ARNs |
| SecretsManager-3 | Non-Compliant | Some secrets are hardcoded in the codebase | Move all hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager |

## AWS IAM

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| IAM-1 | Non-Compliant | Some IAM policies use wildcard (*) resources | Restrict IAM policies to specific resources |
| IAM-2 | Non-Compliant | Some IAM policies use wildcard (*) actions | Restrict IAM policies to specific actions |
| IAM-3 | Compliant | IAM roles follow separation of duties | Continue using separate roles for different functions |
| IAM-4 | Compliant | IAM roles are scoped to specific services | Continue using service-specific roles |

## AWS DynamoDB

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| DynamoDB-1 | Unknown | DynamoDB table encryption status is not specified | Ensure DynamoDB tables are encrypted with KMS |
| DynamoDB-2 | Unknown | DynamoDB table backup configuration is not specified | Configure point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB tables |
| DynamoDB-3 | Unknown | DynamoDB table access patterns are not specified | Ensure appropriate IAM policies for DynamoDB access |

## AWS Bedrock

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Bedrock-1 | Compliant | Bedrock access is restricted to specific models | Continue restricting access to specific models |
| Bedrock-2 | Compliant | Bedrock API calls are made from within a VPC | Continue using VPC for Bedrock API calls |
| Bedrock-3 | Unknown | Input validation for Bedrock API calls is not specified | Implement input validation for Bedrock API calls |

## AWS VPC

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| VPC-1 | Compliant | Resources are deployed within a VPC | Continue using VPC for network isolation |
| VPC-2 | Compliant | Security groups are used to restrict network access | Continue using security groups for network security |
| VPC-3 | Unknown | VPC flow logs configuration is not specified | Enable VPC flow logs for network monitoring |

## AWS CloudWatch

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| CloudWatch-1 | Non-Compliant | CloudWatch Log Groups are not encrypted with KMS | Configure KMS encryption for CloudWatch Log Groups |
| CloudWatch-2 | Unknown | CloudWatch Logs retention period is not specified | Configure appropriate retention periods for CloudWatch Logs |
| CloudWatch-3 | Unknown | CloudWatch Alarms configuration is not specified | Configure alarms for critical metrics |

## AWS SSM

| Control ID | Compliance Status | Details | Recommendations |
|------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| SSM-1 | Compliant | SSM is used for command execution | Continue using SSM for secure command execution |
| SSM-2 | Unknown | SSM document permissions are not specified | Ensure SSM documents have appropriate permissions |
| SSM-3 | Unknown | SSM command output logging is not specified | Configure logging for SSM command output |

## Summary of Findings

### Critical Issues:
1. XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Lambda function
2. Hardcoded secrets in the codebase
3. Missing timeouts in HTTP requests
4. Missing error handling in HTTP requests

### High Priority Issues:
1. Lambda functions without Dead Letter Queues
2. Lambda functions without concurrent execution limits
3. Unencrypted CloudWatch Logs
4. IAM policies with wildcard resources and actions

### Medium Priority Issues:
1. Hardcoded ARNs for secrets
2. Missing encryption for Lambda environment variables
3. Missing VPC flow logs
4. Missing CloudWatch alarms

### Low Priority Issues:
1. Unspecified DynamoDB encryption
2. Unspecified CloudWatch Logs retention
3. Unspecified SSM document permissions
